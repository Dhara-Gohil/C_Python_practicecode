# C_Python_practicecode

Welcome to my repository for practicing **C** and **Python** programming! This repository contains various code snippets, practice exercises, and small projects that I've worked on to improve my skills in both languages.


## ðŸ’» **Languages Used**

- **C Language**: Focused on basic syntax, data structures (arrays, linked lists, etc.), algorithms (sorting, searching), and small projects.
- **Python Language**: Includes basics, object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and small automation scripts.

## ðŸš€ **How to Run the Code**

### **For C Programs:**

1. **Compile the code** using GCC or any C compiler:
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o output
   ./output
   ```

### **For Python Programs:**

1. **Make sure you have Python installed.** Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```
